<h1> Microsoft Codefundo++ 2019 : Secure Electronic Voting System in IIT Guwahati using Blockchain </h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
  Elections, referenda, and polls are very important processes & tools for the smooth operation of a modern democracy.But this process is bound with so many problems ,be it the delays in conducting the elections  as well as declaring the results due to its time consuming process.In our college  , we have encountered the same hassle on the election day , those long queues , some students are unable to vote due to some motion impairmant, involvement of so many officials so as to ensure the smooth functioning of this hectic process.This problem is prominent  wherever we need to conduct any elections.
  
  
  So , here are we with our idea , what if the entire process is in online mode. In this modern era , almost everyone has an android phone , so why not make an application so that voters even if being far from the voting place can cast their votes by some basic registration processes in that appliction in their phone , then we'll integrate his/her choice of voting  with the IITG server & using the azure blockchain technology to secure the entire voting process.


<h2>Idea</h2>
 
We are going to use azure blockchain technology to make the entire election process reliable , secure & transparent.Our basic motto is to safely store all the voter's final choices so that noone can tamper it using unfair means . For that we are using blockchain technology to add all the students (voters) as the nodes in the blockchain .We will also create a host website for IITG , acting as a server that keeps a count of all the votes. While the voting choices are getting stored in the host site , there is high chances of some hacking in the process , so what we are going to do is as soon as we detect some changes in the stored data in the server , we'll inform all the nodes of the blockchain that there is some malfunctioning in the election process.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<h4>Pre-election</h4></br>
Cryptography underlying blockchain technology helps us ensure that digital content comes from a trusted source.
<h4>During election</h4>
Blockchain's immutable ledger can help store identity data for authenticating voters , and help securely record digital votes for tabulation.
<h4>Post election</h4>
Individual voters and election officials can each audit the eletion's outcome on a public blockchain.

<h2>How is it useful</h2>
(describe the security involved, and the time limit reduction, ease of access from android phone itself, as well as the idea of using iitg email ID as the identification standard)

<h2>Challenges</h2>
  Don't fill it now.. it'd be filled later when we face real challenges.. you may even remove or comment this point..
  
<h2>Workflow</h2>
need to make one by tonight...
