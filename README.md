<h1> Microsoft Codefundo++ 2019 : Secure Electronic Voting System in IIT Guwahati using Blockchain </h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
  
  1. Usual problem with voting in the country, long time process, delays --- then in this paragraph describe those with our college, a whole day process, hassle in CCC, problems for students with motion impairment, etc.. 
  2.Even this problem is very prominent in other colleges.. that are non IITs, because there elections take place over weeks, and manually.
  3.Every student has an android, so it's quite easy if we are able to make an android app for the same,and then integrate it with the IITG server, to secure voting with block chain.
  
<h2>Idea</h2>
 
We are going to use azure blockchain technology to make the entire election process reliable , secure & transparent.Our basic motto is to safely store all the voter's final choices so that noone can tamper it using unfair means . For that we are using blockchain technology to add all the students (voters) as the nodes in the blockchain .We will also create a host website for IITG , acting as a server that keeps a count of all the votes. While the voting choices are getting stored in the host site , there is high chances of some hacking in the process , so what we are going to do is as soon as we detect some changes in the stored data in the server , we'll inform all the nodes of the blockchain that there is some malfunctioning in the election process.
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<h4>
Pre-election</h4></br>
Cryptography underlying blockchain technology helps us ensure that digital content comes from a trusted source.
<h4>During electio</h4>
Blockchain's immutable ledger can help store identity data for authenticating voters , and help securely record digital votes for tabulation.
<h4>Post election</h4>
Individual voters and election officials can each audit the eletion's outcome on a public blockchain.

<h2>How is it useful</h2>
(describe the security involved, and the time limit reduction, ease of access from android phone itself, as well as the idea of using iitg email ID as the identification standard)

<h2>Challenges</h2>
  Don't fill it now.. it'd be filled later when we face real challenges.. you may even remove or comment this point..
  
<h2>Workflow</h2>
need to make one by tonight...

  A few other things to note...
  1. comment out the descriptions I've given, make a fair draft and then remove the comments. 
  2. If you guys have some other points to add, feel free to..
  3. for explaining the problem we can add more examples.
  4. Keep the idea short 1 paragrph.
  5.And remeber the total wrods that we're permitted to use should not exceed 500.. and comment out this section too.. All the best!
