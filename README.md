<h1> Microsoft Codefundo++ 2019 : Secured Electronic Voting System in IIT Guwahati using Blockchain </h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
  (describe the following points......
  1. Usual problem with voting in the country, long time process, delays --- then in this paragraph describe those with our college, a whole day process, hassle in CCC, problems for students with motion impairment, etc.. 
  2.Even this problem is very prominent in other colleges.. that are non IITs, because there elections take place over weeks, and manually.
  3.Every student has an android, so it's quite easy if we are able to make an android app for the same,and then integrate it with the IITG server, to secure voting with block chain.
  
<h2>Idea</h2>
(describe the idea.... if you wanna add something else then do.. fundamentally we'll add the students aka the voters as nodes in the blockchain, as well as a server that keeps a vote count(maybe a host website for IITG). 

<h2>How is it useful</h2>
(describe the security involved, and the time limit reduction, ease of access from android phone itself, as well as the idea of using iitg email ID as the identification standard)

<h2>Challenges</h2>
  Don't fill it now.. it'd be filled later when we face real challenges.. you may even remove or comment this point..
  
<h2>Workflow</h2>
need to make one by tonight...
