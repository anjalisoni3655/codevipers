<h1> Microsoft Codefundo++ 2019 : Secure Electronic Voting System in IIT Guwahati using Blockchain </h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Elections, referenda, and polls are very important processes & tools for the smooth operation of a modern democracy. But, usually these processes are infested with a lot of problems, be it the delays in conducting the elections or declaring the results due to its time-consuming nature.</p>

Even in our college, IIT Guwahati, we have faced a similar scenario on the electionâ€™s day here, with long queues, involvement of so many officials, guards and supporting staffs. A whole academic day is wasted in the process. Moreover, many students, who are suffering from motion impairments, are unable to cast their votes. Same is the case with many other colleges all over the country.

This motivates the use of a better and easily accessible method of voting. Almost everyone has an Android based phone these days, and thus we decided to make an Android application, for the students to register with their IITG email ID (to authenticate) and then vote throughout the election day, right from their hostels or any convenient place in the campus. This will be integrated with the IITG Students' Affairs section and using blockchain we can secure the entire process very efficiently.


<h2>Idea</h2>
 
We are going to use azure blockchain technology to make the entire election process reliable, secure & transparent. Our basic motto is to safely store all the voters' final choices so that no one can tamper with it. For this purpose, we are using blockchain technology to add all the students (voters) as the nodes in the blockchain. We will also create a host website for IITG, that will keep a count of all the votes, while the Android App Provides the UI for voting. By using the concept of Smart Contract, the whole process can be guaranteed to stay secure.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h4>Pre-election</h4>
Cryptography underlying blockchain technology helps us ensure that digital content comes from a trusted source.

<h4>During elections</h4>
Blockchain's immutable ledger can help store identity data for authenticating voters , and help securely record digital votes for tabulation.

<h4>Post election</h4>
Individual voters and election officials can each audit the eletion's outcome on a public blockchain.

<h2>How is it useful?</h2>

<h3>More Security</h3>
Using Blockchain to save data of users keeps it safe and unaltered, because the data is encrypted and has to be validated by a consensus protocol in order to be altered.

<h3>Transparency</h3>
It is stored in decentralized manner which allows each user to have a copy of the alterations to the blockchain. This would substantially minimize the threat of the data being corrupted, while at the same time promote transparency into the voting process.

<h3>Faster process</h3>
A tamper-proof online voting model would make the the whole voting process significantly faster as it would prevent long queues outside the polling booth as is what happens, for instance, in college committee elections.

<h3>Easily accessible</h3>
Every student and faculty of IIT Guwahati gets a webmail ID at the time of enrollment which would form the basis of unique identification for each voter. This would enable them to easily vote through our Android app without having to wait in queues or even go anywhere.
